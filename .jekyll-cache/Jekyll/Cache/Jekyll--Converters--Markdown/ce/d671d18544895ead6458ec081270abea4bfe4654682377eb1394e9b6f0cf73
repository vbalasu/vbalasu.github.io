<p>In recent years, we have seen cloud computing take off in a big way. Organizations are increasingly taking advantage of the elastic nature of the cloud, which allows them to achieve better utilization of computing resources. Rather than over-provisioning infrastructure to accommodate peak capacity, organizations are adopting a strategy of <em>bursting to the cloud</em> to handle spikes in their infrastructure needs.</p>

<p>However, hybrid cloud introduces some new challenges. Data gets fragmented between on-premise repositories and cloud repositories. Each repository has its own proprietory storage format, and are often incompatible with each other.</p>

<p>However, answering key business questions often require data that spans across these two worlds. How are we to cope?</p>

<p>In this article, I will explain how you can use Trifacta to greatly simplify your data preparation efforts on data that is stored on premises. This follows a <code class="highlighter-rouge">hybrid cloud</code> model, where you freely mingle on-premises data stored in local disk drives and shared network filesystems, with data stored in the cloud in object storage, relational databases and cloud data warehouses.</p>

<p>We will walk through a scenario which involves:</p>
