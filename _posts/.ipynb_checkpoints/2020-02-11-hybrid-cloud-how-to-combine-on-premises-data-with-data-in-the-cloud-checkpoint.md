#### Hybrid Cloud

In recent years, we have seen cloud computing take off in a big way. Organizations are increasingly taking advantage of the elastic nature of the cloud, which allows them to achieve better utilization of computing resources. Rather than over-provisioning infrastructure to accommodate peak capacity, organizations are adopting a strategy of *bursting to the cloud* to handle spikes in their infrastructure needs.

However, hybrid cloud introduces some new challenges. Data gets fragmented between on-premise repositories and cloud repositories. Each repository has its own proprietory storage format, and are often incompatible with each other. 

However, answering key business questions often require data that spans across these two worlds. How are we to cope?

#### Data Preparation To The Rescue

In this article, I will explain how you can use Trifacta to greatly simplify your data preparation efforts on data that is stored on premises. This follows a `hybrid cloud` model, where you freely mingle on-premises data stored in local disk drives and shared network filesystems, with data stored in the cloud in object storage, relational databases and cloud data warehouses.
